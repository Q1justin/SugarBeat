# SugarBeat

A React Native app to help people track and reduce their added sugar consumption.

## Development

### Supabase Types

After making changes to the database schema, update TypeScript types by running:
```bash
npm run update-types
```

This will regenerate the type definitions in `src/types/supabase.ts` to match your current database schema.
